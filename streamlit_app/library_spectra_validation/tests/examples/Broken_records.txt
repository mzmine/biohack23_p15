I clean all the 12 mass spectra in the "test_case_correct.mgf", in terms of 
--> adding inchikey
--> cleaning the inchi
--> adding formula

So all mass spectra in the "test_case_wrong.mgf" are missing formula and inchikey

mass spectrum 1: no change
mass spectrum 2: wrong adduct
mass spectrum 3: wrong pepmass (precursor)
mass spectrum 4: wrong smiles
mass spectrum 5: missing adduct
mass spectrum 6: no change (share the same compound name as mass spectrum 5, but different adduct)
mass spectrum 7: missing adduct
mass spectrum 8: missing adduct
mass spectrum 9: no change
mass spectrum 10: missing compound name and adduct
mass spectrum 11: no change
mass spectrum 12: wroing inchi
